# String Necklace

Given a string, imagine it as beads on a necklace. All rotations are equivalent: "NICOLE" == "ICOLEN" == "COLENI".

- Given two strings, are they equivalent as necklaces?
- How many times is the input string formed when rotating through all N characters?
- Given the [enable1 word list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dolph/dictionary/master/enable1.txt), find the four words which describe the same necklace.
